# KNOCK KNOCK

Now that everyone is working from home thanks to COVID-19, I built an app that lets you know when you can or can't go bother your partner/flatmate/parents/sibling/dog/etc. Avoid interuptions mid-Zoom call.

The app lets you set your status and view the status of those in your house.

## Statuses

- üõë = Do Not Disturb 
- ‚ö†Ô∏è= Busy but not on a call
- ‚úÖ = open for distractions

## Built With
- React
- node.js
- Express
- PostgreSQL

## Running the Program

### Server

To launch the server, run:

```
$ cd server
$ node index.js
```

### Client

To launch the front end client, run:

```
$ cd client
$ npm start
```
